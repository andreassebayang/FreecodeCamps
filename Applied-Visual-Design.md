# Applied-Visual-Design
Visual design is a combination of typography, color theory, graphics, animation, page layout, and more to help deliver your unique message.  In this course, you'll learn how to apply these different elements of visual design to your webpages.

## 1. Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property
This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the `text-align` property.
`text-align: justify;` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

`text-align: center;` centers the text

`text-align: right;` right-aligns the text

`text-align: left;` (the default) left-aligns the text.

## 2. Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property
You can specify the width of an element using the `width` property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as `em`), absolute length units (such as `px`), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:
```
img {
  width: 220px;
}
```

## 3. Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property
You can specify the height of an element using the `height` property in CSS, similar to the `width` property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:
```
img {
  height: 20px;
}
```

## 4. Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold
To make text bold, you can use the `strong` tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the `strong` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `font-weight: bold;` to the element.

strong can be use likely tag

## 5. Use the u Tag to Underline Text
To underline text, you can use the `u` tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element.

## 6. Use the em Tag to Italicize Text
To emphasize text, you can use the `em` tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of font-style: italic; to the element.

## 7. Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text
To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the `s` tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the `s` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: line-through;` to the element.

## 8. Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element
You can use the `hr` tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.

## 9. Adjust the background-color Property of Text
Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a `background-color` to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses `rgba()` instead of `hex` codes or normal `rgb()`.
```
rgba stands for:
  r = red
  g = green
  b = blue
  a = alpha/level of opacity
```
The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. rgba() is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.
You'll use `background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)` for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.

## 10. Adjust the Size of a Header Versus a Paragraph Tag
The font size of header tags (`h1`through  `h6`) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the `font-size` property to adjust the size of the text in an element.

## 11. Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element
The `box-shadow` property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The `box-shadow` property takes values for
* `offset-x` (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
* `offset-y` (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
* `blur-radius`,
* `spread-radiu` and
* `color`, in that order.
The `blur-radius` and `spread-radius` values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each `box-shadow` element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:
```
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
```
example:
```
#thumbnail{
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
}
```

## 13. Decrease the Opacity of an Element
The  `opacity` property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.
 ```
A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.
```
The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.
```
.links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
    opacity: 0.7;
```

## 14. Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase
The `text-transform` property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.
The following table shows how the different `text-transform` values change the example text "Transform me".
```
Value	                                  Result
lowercase	                          "transform me"
uppercase	                          "TRANSFORM ME"
capitalize	                        "Transform Me"
initial	                        Use the default value
inherit	          Use the text-transform value from the parent element
none	                     Default: Use the original text
```
Example:
```
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
    text-transform: uppercase;
  }
 ```

# 15. Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements
The `font-size` property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all `h1` through `h6` tags to balance the heading sizes.

In the `style` tags, set the `font-size` of the:
* h1 tag to 68px.
* h2 tag to 52px.
* h3 tag to 40px.
* h4 tag to 32px.
* h5 tag to 21px.
* h6 tag to 14px.

```
<style>
h1{
  font-size: 68px;
}
h2{
  font-size: 52px;
}
h3{
  font-size: 40px;
}
h4{
  font-size: 32px;
}
h5{
  font-size: 21px;
}
h6{
  font-size: 14px;
}
</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>
```
